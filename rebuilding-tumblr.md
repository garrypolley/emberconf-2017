# Tumblr to single page app

Speaker: Oli Griffiths

* Labs as a way to do out of roadmap work, half day dedicated each week
* Addons are pretty great way to add functionality to your ember apps, it's why Ember is great

## Some addons to look at

* `ember-simple-auth`
* `liquid-fire` -- for animations
* `ember-in-viewport`
* `ember-cli-autoprefixer`
* `broccoli-manifest` -- does some nice app stuff locally for storing content
* `ember-component-css` -- allows focused css targetting
* `ember-cli-flash` -- alerts and dialogs
* `ember-concurrency` -- used for concurrent operations, kind of like a setTimeout
* `ember-data-actions` -- lets you do fancy action stuff that's not so restful

## Takeaway

* Maybe used `ember-concurrency` for our loan adjustments
* Maybe use Ember to help build out a styleguide, the living style guide could hold all the examples all the time
* emberaddons website for looking at addons for ember.
