# Empowering Creators

Speaker: Edward Faulkner

Talk is about the size of frameworks and features they offer, and how you can go "bigger and bigger"
all the way up to the WordPress like environments of the world.

glimmer -> ember -> wordpress

## Strengths of Ember

* Ember HTML uses the "principle of least power" to make it easier to build templates.
* Addon ecosystem is very large
* Community invested in shared standards

## CardStack application architecture

* http://cardstack.io/
* mobiledoc for rich text areas
* Look at `ember-overlays`, gives nice overlay/highlights you can show
  * could be a nice "guide" for a site when used with `ember-concurrency`
* `cardstack/hub` is the location for all the data grabbing and updating

This talk seems like a way to get people to use these libraries

## Takeaway

* I may want to look into this for the paper local site idea
