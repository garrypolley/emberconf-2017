## Addon needs

## Some addons to look at

* ember-metrics --> https://github.com/poteto/ember-metrics

## To be successful

* You must solve a problem
* You must convience poeple your addon solves the problem in the best way

Idea to use `data-test-selector` to make some testing easier, will remove when you build it correctly.
`treeForAddon` will help determine what should be packaged at build time with your addon.


Look at `ember-twiddle` you can put addons on there now. https://ember-twiddle.com/

## configuration options

* Can be `app/SOME_FILE`
* Can be in `config/environment.js`
* Can be set in the `ember-build-file.js`
