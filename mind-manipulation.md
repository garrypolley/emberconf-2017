# Mind Manipulation

Opened with bubbles...

Works with Heroku, and they have nice fastboot support.

Talk will cover

* Cognitive Restructory (self change)
* How you make changes to groups

## Cognitive

* Opportunites
* How the brain works
* Cognitive behavioral theropy

### Opportunity

* in moment
  * arguments
  * snapping at kids
  * Getting hangry
* or reflecting -- after the fact

### How the brain works

* Inner Brain
  * Limbic System, "low road"
  * Super fast, milliseconds
* Outer Brain
  * Cortex, lots of thinking
  * "high road" slow seconds

* Automatic thoughts/feelings
* Deliberate thoughts/feelings
  * downward spiral, when bad stuff keeps adding on and making it worse and worse


### Cognitive Behavioral Theorpy

Cut in here to stop the downard spiral of emotions

Can be as effective for treating depression. Good for treating mental illness.

`npm install constant-introspection`

CBT:

1. Whoop! -- you realize you're about to do something bad/negative
1. Input -- from the **environment**
    * doors, stools  etc
    * thoughts and feelings can "just show up"
    * body state, e.g. hangry
1. Emotions & Thoughts
    * Processing emotions
        * Need to talk to folks when you feel upset for processing emotions
        * Journaling can help
        * Reading fiction can also help
    * View emotions as data, so you can see/understand them more
    * More adaptive thoughts
        * I am feeling frustrated
        * Hangry will go away once I eat
1. Response
    * Use the afore mention parts to do better after response

#### Other CBT tools

* Therapist
* CBT Book "Feeilng Good"
* Headspace (app)
* Joyable (webapp)

## Group Changes

PsycSafe Group

Current meber(s) feel safe, not necessarily the best choice, but it does work

### What made group perform better

* Group norms helped a lot
* Personality types did not
* skills also did not matter as much


### PsyscSafe Traits

* Communication (turn taking conversation)
* Empathy (social sensitivity)
* Leads to higher group IQ (6/6 is better than 5/6 in a goal)


### 10 techniques

#### Communication

Way that communication can be improved

##### 1 Earned dogmatism effect

I am experienced, therefore my idea is right

* Show them information is missing
* This goes both ways, one or more

##### 2 Declare Unknowns

We don't fully understand X yet

##### 3 Framing

"Learning opportunity" not "bad wrong bad"

Point out how a bad can lead to something getting better.

##### 4 Acknowledge Fallibility

I make mistakes and I know it - tell me what you notice

##### 5 Model Curiosity

Ask many questions

#### Empathy

##### 1 Propinquity

Social closeness, people you are close to with stuff e.g. lunch stuff

higher trust for these folks because of working. Higher propinquity helps with working together.

"P.E.A.R.L.S."

* Partnership
    * I really want to work on this with you
    * I bet we can figure this out ogether
* Empahty
* .. more

##### 2 Task vs Relationship

###### Task

potential issues with your idea

###### 3 Relationship

You aren't competent

#### 4 Validation

Recognition and acceptance of another perons's thoughts etc. as understandable, not necessarilly that you agree

Leves for these:

1. Be Present
1. Accurate Reflection
1. Mind Reading
1. Context; their backgorund
1. anyone would
1. Radical Genuineness

##### 5 Depersonalize ideas

Focus on "idea A" not "casey's idea"

Helps decouple ego from project, and lets folks say critical things without having to worry about offending others

##### 6 Vulnerability

Increases trust

If you can share things that have occurred and be a little more open you'll help your team out more. And help yourself out
in the process as well.
